# CANIS-Hackathon-Foreign-Interference-Analysis-Dashboard

### Motivation
The growing frequency of disinformation and foreign influence in the digital era inspired me. I intended to design a tool that not only raises awareness of these challenges, but also helps users to comprehend and detect the various subtleties of digital influence and intervention on worldwide platforms.

### Functionality
The Foreign Interference Analysis Dashboard is an advanced tool that analyzes, categorizes, and visualizes the level of foreign influence and interference across social media platforms. It distinguishes between state actors and influencers, offering information on their reach, effect, and target locations.


### How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements
3. Run the `main.py` file
4. Open the `dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI **__(To be added soon)__**

### How I Made It
This dashboard was created using a combination of Python for data analysis and cleaning, as well as Pandas and Scikit-learn for advanced data processing. I used Power BI for visualization because of its dynamic dashboard features and user-friendly interface.

### Obstacles I encountered
One significant problem was effectively distinguishing between state actors and influencers, which required a thorough investigation of entity ownership and intent. Another challenge was guaranteeing data accuracy and dealing with massive amounts of data from many social media networks.
### Achievements that I am proud of
I'm very pleased of my dashboard's ability to distinguish between influence and interference while still delivering a clear, user-friendly layout that makes complicated data approachable. My creative use of network graphs to depict follower data was also noteworthy.

### What I discovered
This study broadened my awareness of the complexity of data analysis in social media situations. I discovered sophisticated data classification techniques, the significance of ethical issues in data management, and the potential of visual storytelling in data display.

### What's next for Foreign Interference Analysis Dashboard?
In the future, I intend to incorporate real-time data analysis, improve my machine learning models for better interference pattern prediction, and expand my dashboard to include other social media platforms. I also intend to work in a collaborative setting to make my tool more available to a larger audience, including educational institutions and policymakers.
